## disruption

```plaintext
Thou art the disruption that doth make my life whole

You are the disruption that makes my life complete,
The unpredictable force that swept me off my feet,
You brought chaos and confusion to my mundane routine,
And showed me the beauty in the things I've never seen.

You challenged my beliefs and shattered my walls,
And made me question the things that I once thought were laws,
You forced me to step out of my comfort zone,
And showed me that growth can only happen when we're alone.

You made me realize that life is not always neat,
And that sometimes we need to accept the bittersweet,
You showed me that perfection is just an illusion,
And that the key to happiness is to embrace the confusion.

You are the disruption that makes my life complete,
And I wouldn't have it any other way, my sweet,
For you taught me the meaning of true love and grace,
And for that, my dear, you will forever hold a special place.
```

```plaintext
You disrupt my life in ways so sweet,
Making the mundane feel complete,
Challenging me to break free from routine,
And see the beauty in the unpredictable scene.
